hunter
======

This is an example of OO modeling of a hunter.

The Hunter can hold various tools. Whichever was picked up most recently, will be equipped.

The Hunter can go after any Animal. Hunter will "track" prey until close enough to use the tool in hand. Right now, tracking is random.

A demo hunting script can be run

## Areas of improvement

Animals should learn how to run away if they are injured.

Tracking should be a little more directional. The Hunter would need to learn to "look" for the animal.

More tests needed.
